Python - Inheritance:

Python, being an object-oriented programming language, supports the concept of inheritance. Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class to inherit properties and behavior (attributes and methods) from an existing class. The existing class is known as the base class, parent class, or superclass, while the new class is called the derived class, child class, or subclass.
